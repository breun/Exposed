Welcome to the `Getting Started with Exposed` tutorial. In this tutorial we are going to create a simple application 
that will demonstrate how to use Exposed to interact with a database.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you need to have a basic understanding of Kotlin programming language. If you're new to Kotlin, 
please check [Learning Materials](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/learning-materials-overview.html) section on the Kotlin website.

You also need to have the following installed on your machine:

On the screenshots, we are using IntelliJ IDEA as our IDE. If you don't have it, you can download
it free from the official [JetBrains website](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/). You can also use any other IDE.
